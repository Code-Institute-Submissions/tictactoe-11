TiK TaK ToE

This project i made not only to fullfill the 2nd milestone but also for my 5 years old girl to have her first approach to video games; and she really liked it.

I choose the colors to be atractive to her taste.

Tik tak toe is one of the most popular games worldwide,  it's simplicity allows the user to interact intuitively even if it's been played for the first time. It can be played at any age, however at this point of my hability to code, i could not set up dificulty levels to the game.

FEATURES
The project has only one front page with a main title on the top.

At the center of the page i bild a table and style it with css to look like a grid surrounded by a circle, rounding the border of the container div.

at the bottom of the page i wrote two sentences; one as mini title and another to briefly explain the purpose of the game. i didnt want to add innecesary text, istead i wanted to keep the space free from any distraction and have just te grid as protagonist.

Features Left to Implement
For a next version, i would like to add a buttons to increase difficulty of the AI.
Also the posibility to have a second human player.
