TiK TaK ToE

This project i made not only to fullfill the 2nd milestone but also for my 5 years old girl to have her first approach to video games; and she really liked it.

I choose the colors to be atractive to her taste.

TiK taK toE is one of the most popular games worldwide,  it's simplicity allows the user to interact intuitively even if it's been played for the first time. It can be played at any age, however at this point of my hability to code, i could not set up dificulty levels to the game.

FEATURES
The project has only one front page with a main title on the top.

At the center of the page i build a table and style it with css to look like a grid surrounded by a circle, rounding the border of the container div.

At the bottom of the page i wrote two sentences; one as subtitle and another to briefly explain the purpose of the game. i didnt want to add innecesary text, instead i wanted to keep the space free from any distraction and have just te grid as protagonist.

in the footer i include a counter fot games played and keep score of the records.

FFEATURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED
For a next version, i would like to add a buttons to increase difficulty of the AI.
Also the posibility to have a second human player.

TESTING
I did functionallity test to confirm the winning statements in both posible results (human or AI) also confirmed the Draw result.

Also confirmed that Replay button works at the end of each game.

Validator Testing

HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

LightHouse Report is included in assets folder.

BUGS
There's one bug that at this point i was not ble to fix, which is the increment function for both human or AI boxes; should increase by 1, but instead increase in groups of three because add one for each box from the winning combination.


ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR ASSESSOR

This code was not my first option for this second milestone project.

I started writting a different project, but i reach a point where i could not solve the issue i had, and having less than 24h to accomplish the hard delivery date, i had to start over a new project. 

My original idea was also a website game called "Cake or Not Challenge". My intention was to take a short 40s video of someone showing an object that coukd be, or not a cake.

I wanted to add a functionallity to stop the video right before each cutting for each object, five times in total around the video.

i manage to create the functions and i also got to stop the video right on time but, i could only stop the video once. 

I spent many hours triying to find a solution but i find myself in a loop with no answer, at least not with my current knowledge. 

My online research was very dissapointing. I spoke to my mentor but he told me he was not allowed to help me with this type of issue in my code, which i totally understand. He recomend me to reach studdent support but i didn't because at that point, i had less than 24 remaining to deliver.

On top of that, the same day i received the feedback for my first project, which i failed, that bring me emotionally down.

For this reason i built this game; I have to give credit to freeCodeCamp.org channel in youtube, from which i took the hard functionallity code for the game. I did however made changes in calling variable names by "let" insteadt= the "var" method used by them, and general sintax; for instance, the guide utilize querySelectors to call elements from the DOM; i did not recognize this method so i change all instances to getElementByID. 

Also i wrotte all customization in the CSS file.

I want to take the opportunitty to let the statement that, i am totally commite to learn and acomplish this tuition succesfully, however, so far i feel overwhelmed and even frustrated; i feel like i have been swallowing theory and not fully understand; neither having enough time to practice (other than the lesson challenges)

CREDITS
I use guidance of freeCodeCamp.org channel in Youtube to develop this project.
